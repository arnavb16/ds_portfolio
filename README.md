# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio tasks done by Arnav Bajaj (46806423) for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021.

There are 3 Portfolio tasks in this repository.

In **Portfolio 1** we do an analysis of Cycling data across 4 different races on the same course 3 years apart. The races are Road Race 2016, Time Trial 2016, Road Race 2019 and Time Trial 2019. We do analysis to find which type of race is faster, where in one race the rider was faster and to find what gear the rider usually rides in.

**Portfolio 2** is an analysis on Federal Government Sport Vouchers program who provide 2 100$ vouchers for kids to take participate in organized sport. This data has been merged with SEIFA measures (Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage measures). We do the analysis for each LGA in both South Australia and Queensland. The analysis is based around the voucher usage per sport and per LGA.

**Portfolio 3** is an analysis of Mobile Customer Churn data. The data is simulated but based on real data provided by Optus. We create a model to predict the customer churn based on various input features from the data collected.
